## Taking Ownership Of An Item

After verifying the authenticity of an item you are, if the item is not already owned, given the option of taking ownership of that item.  To take ownership of an item:

* Type your email address into the text box
* Click the **COMPLETE VERIFICATION** button

At this point you are the "owner" of the item.  This means that your account is associated with the digital ID attached to this item.  You will receive an email containing a _digital receipt_ of the item. 

At this point every time you log into your CP3 account this item will be visible in your ***Portfolio***.
